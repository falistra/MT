  # Adds 1 to a binary number.
  input: '1011'
  blank: ' '
  start state: right
  table:
    # scan to the rightmost digit
    right:
      [1,0]: R
      ' '  : {L: carry}
    # then carry the 1
    carry:
      1      : {write: 0, L}
      [0,' ']: {write: 1, L: done}
    done:


  # Exercises:

  # • Modify the machine to always halt on the leftmost digit
  #   (regardless of the number's length).
  #   Hint: add a state between carry and done.

  # • Make a machine that adds 2 instead of 1.
  #   Hint: 2 is '10' in binary, so the last digit is unaffected.
  #   Alternative hint: chain together two copies of the machine from
  #   the first exercise (renaming the states of the second copy).

  # • Make a machine to subtract 1.
  #   To simplify things, assume the input is always greater than 0.
positions:
  right: {x: 230, y: 250}
  carry: {x: 400, y: 250}
